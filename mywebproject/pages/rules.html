            <h2>Basic Rules of Pickleball</h2>
            <p>Pickleball can be played either as doubles (two players per team) or singles, with doubles being the most common format. The same playing area and rules apply to both singles and doubles.</p>

            <h3>The Serve</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The server's arm must move in an upward arc when the ball is struck.</li>
                <li>Paddle contact with the ball must be below waist level.</li>
                <li>The head of the paddle must not be above the wrist at contact.</li>
                <li>A 'drop serve' is permitted, where the above conditions do not apply.</li>
                <li>At the time of the serve, the serverâ€™s feet must not touch the court outside the baseline.</li>
                <li>The serve is diagonal crosscourt and must land within the opposite diagonal court.</li>
                <li>Only one serve attempt is allowed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Serving Sequence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Both players on the serving doubles team get a chance to serve and score points until they commit a fault.</li>
                <li>The first serve of each side-out is from the right/even court.</li>
                <li>As points are scored, the server switches between the right/even and left/odd courts.</li>
                <li>After the first server loses the serve, the partner serves from the correct court.</li>
                <li>The second server serves until a fault is committed, then the service moves to the opposing team.</li>
                <li>In singles, the server serves from the right/even court when the score is even and from the left/odd court when the score is odd.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Points are scored only by the serving team.</li>
                <li>Games are normally to 11 points, win by 2.</li>
                <li>Tournament games may be to 15 or 21, win by 2.</li>
                <li>The serving team's score determines the serving court.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Two-Bounce Rule</h3>
            <p>After the serve, each team must let the ball bounce once before hitting it, effectively creating two bounces. This rule extends rallies and reduces the serve-and-volley advantage.</p>

            <h3>Line Calls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A ball touching any part of a line, except the non-volley zone line on a serve, is considered in.</li>
                <li>A serve hitting the non-volley zone line is a fault.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Non-Volley Zone</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The non-volley zone, or 'the kitchen,' is 7 feet on both sides of the net.</li>
                <li>Volleying is prohibited within the non-volley zone.</li>
                <li>A fault occurs if a player volleys the ball and steps into the non-volley zone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Faults</h3>
            <p>A fault is a rule violation that stops play. A fault by the receiving team gives a point to the serving team. A fault by the serving team results in the loss of serve or a side out.</p>

            <h3>Determining Serving Team</h3>
            <p>The serving team can be determined by any fair method, such as a coin flip.</p>
